# Listen Feature Module - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Listen feature enables OA Coder to capture and process audio input, converting speech to text for AI analysis and conversation tracking. This module handles system audio capture, speech-to-text processing, and conversation session management for audio-based interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio Capture System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to capture system audio and microphone input, so that I can interact with the AI using voice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start listening THEN the system SHALL request audio permissions
2. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL initialize audio capture
3. WHEN on macOS THEN the system SHALL use native loopback audio capture
4. WHEN on Windows THEN the system SHALL use system audio capture APIs
5. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL process it in real-time
6. WHEN I stop listening THEN the system SHALL cleanly close audio sessions

### Requirement 2: Speech-to-Text Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want my speech to be accurately converted to text, so that the AI can understand my voice commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL send it to STT services
2. WHEN speech is detected THEN the system SHALL convert it to text accurately
3. WHEN multiple speakers are present THEN the system SHALL identify different speakers
4. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL display the text immediately
5. WHEN STT fails THEN the system SHALL retry with fallback providers
6. WHEN language is configured THEN the system SHALL use appropriate language models

### Requirement 3: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my voice conversations to be organized into sessions, so that I can track and review them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start listening THEN the system SHALL create a new session
2. WHEN transcriptions are generated THEN the system SHALL save them to the session
3. WHEN I end a session THEN the system SHALL finalize and store all data
4. WHEN I view session history THEN the system SHALL display all transcripts
5. WHEN sessions are long THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently
6. WHEN I delete a session THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data

### Requirement 4: Real-time Transcription Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see transcriptions as they happen, so that I can verify accuracy and follow the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speech is processed THEN the system SHALL display transcription immediately
2. WHEN multiple speakers talk THEN the system SHALL show speaker identification
3. WHEN transcription updates THEN the system SHALL highlight new content
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL show status indicators
5. WHEN audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels
6. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL finalize the display

### Requirement 5: Audio Session Lifecycle

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable audio session management, so that I can start and stop listening without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click Listen THEN the system SHALL initialize all audio services
2. WHEN initialization fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN I click Stop THEN the system SHALL gracefully close all audio streams
4. WHEN I click Done THEN the system SHALL finalize the session and hide the interface
5. WHEN the app closes THEN the system SHALL clean up all audio resources
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to the user
