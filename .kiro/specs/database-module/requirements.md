# Database Module - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Database module provides local data persistence for OA Coder using SQLite, ensuring user privacy and offline functionality. This module handles database initialization, schema management, data access through repositories, and maintains data integrity across application sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Initialization and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable database system that initializes automatically, so that user data is always available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a SQLite database
2. WHEN the database doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with proper schema
3. WHEN the database exists THEN the system SHALL validate and update schema if needed
4. WHEN schema changes are required THEN the system SHALL migrate data safely
5. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL close database connections gracefully
6. WHEN database corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery or reinitialize

### Requirement 2: User and Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my sessions and conversations to be organized and persistent, so that I can access my history anytime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application THEN the system SHALL create or use a default user profile
2. WHEN I start a conversation THEN the system SHALL create a new session
3. WHEN I interact with features THEN the system SHALL associate data with the current session
4. WHEN sessions are created THEN the system SHALL track session type (ask/listen)
5. WHEN I end a session THEN the system SHALL update the session status
6. WHEN I delete sessions THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data

### Requirement 3: Message and Transcript Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my conversations and transcripts to be saved locally, so that my data remains private and accessible offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send messages to AI THEN the system SHALL save them to the database
2. WHEN AI responds THEN the system SHALL save responses with proper attribution
3. WHEN audio is transcribed THEN the system SHALL save transcripts with speaker identification
4. WHEN conversations are long THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently
5. WHEN I search conversations THEN the system SHALL provide fast query results
6. WHEN data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity

### Requirement 4: Settings and Configuration Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my preferences and settings to be remembered, so that the application behaves consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change settings THEN the system SHALL persist them to the database
2. WHEN I configure API keys THEN the system SHALL store them securely
3. WHEN I create presets THEN the system SHALL save them for future use
4. WHEN I customize shortcuts THEN the system SHALL remember my preferences
5. WHEN I export settings THEN the system SHALL provide complete configuration data
6. WHEN I import settings THEN the system SHALL validate and apply them safely

### Requirement 5: Repository Pattern and Data Access

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean data access patterns, so that database operations are consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use repository pattern for abstraction
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL provide consistent interfaces
3. WHEN handling transactions THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without data loss
5. WHEN queries are complex THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance
6. WHEN data relationships exist THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity

### Requirement 6: Data Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and private, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt it appropriately
2. WHEN accessing the database THEN the system SHALL use secure file permissions
3. WHEN API keys are stored THEN the system SHALL use platform-specific secure storage
4. WHEN data is deleted THEN the system SHALL ensure complete removal
5. WHEN the database is backed up THEN the system SHALL maintain security
6. WHEN data is exported THEN the system SHALL provide privacy controls
