# AI Integration Module - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Integration module provides a unified interface for connecting to multiple AI service providers, managing API keys securely, and handling model selection and configuration. This module abstracts the complexity of different AI APIs and provides consistent functionality across providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Provider Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama), so that I can choose the best model for each task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure an API key THEN the system SHALL support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Ollama providers
2. WHEN I select a provider THEN the system SHALL route requests to the appropriate API
3. WHEN providers have different capabilities THEN the system SHALL adapt requests accordingly
4. WHEN I switch providers THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
5. WHEN providers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options
6. WHEN new providers are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them seamlessly

### Requirement 2: Unified Streaming Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent interface for streaming responses, so that all providers work the same way in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any provider streams responses THEN the system SHALL use a unified interface
2. WHEN streaming starts THEN the system SHALL provide consistent event handling
3. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors uniformly across providers
4. WHEN responses are complete THEN the system SHALL signal completion consistently
5. WHEN cancellation is requested THEN the system SHALL abort streams reliably
6. WHEN different providers have different formats THEN the system SHALL normalize them

### Requirement 3: API Key Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my API keys to be stored securely, so that my credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter an API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt it before storage
2. WHEN I validate an API key THEN the system SHALL test it with the provider
3. WHEN API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN I remove an API key THEN the system SHALL delete it securely
5. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load API keys securely
6. WHEN API keys expire THEN the system SHALL prompt for renewal

### Requirement 4: Model Selection and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose specific models from each provider, so that I can optimize for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a provider THEN the system SHALL show available models
2. WHEN I choose a model THEN the system SHALL configure it for use
3. WHEN models have different capabilities THEN the system SHALL indicate limitations
4. WHEN I change models THEN the system SHALL update configuration immediately
5. WHEN models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show alternatives
6. WHEN new models are released THEN the system SHALL detect and offer them

### Requirement 5: Local Model Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use local AI models through Ollama, so that I can work offline and maintain privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Ollama is installed THEN the system SHALL detect and connect to it
2. WHEN I select local models THEN the system SHALL manage them through Ollama
3. WHEN local models need downloading THEN the system SHALL handle the process
4. WHEN Ollama is not running THEN the system SHALL attempt to start it
5. WHEN local models are slow THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback
6. WHEN Ollama fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to cloud providers

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable AI interactions even when services have issues, so that my workflow isn't interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately
3. WHEN providers are down THEN the system SHALL suggest alternatives
4. WHEN network is unstable THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
5. WHEN responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL parse them safely
6. WHEN quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance
