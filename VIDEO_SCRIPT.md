# OA Coder - Hackathon Demo Video Script

## Video Duration: 2 minutes 45 seconds

### [0:00-0:15] Opening Hook & Product Demo

**Visual:** OA Coder application running on desktop
**Narration:**
"Meet OA Coder - an AI-powered productivity assistant that I built entirely using Kiro. Watch this: I can have a voice conversation with multiple AI providers, share visual context by dragging images, and get intelligent responses instantly."

**Actions to Show:**
- Launch OA Coder from system tray
- Start voice recording, ask "Analyze this code architecture"
- Drag a screenshot into the chat
- Show AI response with code suggestions
- Switch AI provider from OpenAI to Anthropic mid-conversation

### [0:15-0:45] Kiro Development Process

**Visual:** Screen recording of Kiro conversations and spec creation
**Narration:**
"Here's how I used Kiro to build this from scratch. I started with high-level requirements, and Kiro helped me break down this complex application into manageable specs."

**Actions to Show:**
- Show conversation with Kiro: "Help me design an AI desktop assistant"
- Display the generated requirements.md file
- Show task breakdown: "Break this into implementable tasks"
- Highlight the 100+ generated tasks across 5 modules

**Key Quote:**
"Kiro didn't just generate code - it architected the entire application structure."

### [0:45-1:30] Code Generation Highlights

**Visual:** Split screen showing Kiro conversations and generated code
**Narration:**
"The most impressive part was Kiro's code generation. Look at this AI provider factory pattern - Kiro generated a complete abstraction layer supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Ollama."

**Actions to Show:**
- Show Kiro conversation: "Create a factory pattern for AI providers"
- Display generated AIProviderFactory.js code
- Show voice processing pipeline generation
- Highlight database repository pattern with encryption

**Code Examples to Highlight:**
```javascript
// Show this generated code on screen
class AIProviderFactory {
  static createProvider(type, config) {
    switch (type) {
      case 'openai': return new OpenAIProvider(config);
      case 'anthropic': return new AnthropicProvider(config);
      // ... other providers
    }
  }
}
```

### [1:30-2:00] Agent Hooks & Workflow Automation

**Visual:** Kiro hooks interface and automated workflows
**Narration:**
"I also leveraged Kiro's agent hooks to automate my development workflow. Every time I save a file, tests run automatically. When I update service files, documentation updates instantly."

**Actions to Show:**
- Open Kiro hooks interface
- Show auto-test hook configuration
- Demonstrate: save a file → tests run automatically
- Show documentation update hook in action

**Hook Examples:**
```json
{
  "trigger": "onFileSave",
  "pattern": "src/**/*.js", 
  "action": "runTests"
}
```

### [2:00-2:30] Technical Architecture & Features

**Visual:** Architecture diagrams and feature demonstrations
**Narration:**
"The result is a sophisticated desktop application with multi-modal AI interaction, voice processing, visual context sharing, and enterprise-grade security - all generated through conversations with Kiro."

**Actions to Show:**
- Display architecture diagram
- Demonstrate voice-to-text processing
- Show encrypted data storage
- Highlight cross-platform compatibility
- Show stealth mode and privacy controls

### [2:30-2:45] Impact & Conclusion

**Visual:** Development stats and future roadmap
**Narration:**
"What would have taken 6+ weeks of manual coding, Kiro helped me complete in just 2 weeks with superior code quality. This is the future of AI-assisted development - and it's available today."

**Final Stats to Show:**
- 5,000+ lines of generated code
- 100+ completed tasks
- 70% development time reduction
- 4 AI providers integrated
- Production-ready application

**Closing Shot:** OA Coder running smoothly with multiple AI conversations
